==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                             *vim-yank-window-intro*

vim-yank-window is a small plugin for moving windows around using yanking and
pasting as an alternative to manually finding the buffer number and splitting
windows.

Although this plugin mentions windows in its name, it essentially moves the
underlying buffer around which means you should not rely on the moved window
being the same, although the buffer will be.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                    *vim-yank-window-usage*

1. Navigate to a window and yank it via default is <c-w>yy.
2. Navigate to another window relative to where you want to paste the yanked
   window.
3. Paste the yanked window using either <c-w>yh, <c-w>yj, <c-w>yk, or <c-w>yl
   for the direction you want or to a new tab page before (<c-w>yT) or after
   (<c-w>yt).
